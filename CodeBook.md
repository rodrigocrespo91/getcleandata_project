Data set that contains the training and test sets merged. 

subject: identifies the subject who performed the activity. (1-30)

type: indicates if the data correspond to train or data set. (Test,Train)

activity: identifies the activity performed. (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying)

total_acc_x_mean: the average acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_y_mean' and 'total_acc_z_mean'.

total_acc_x_sdv: the standard deviation of acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_y_sdv' and 'total_acc_z_sdv'.

body_acc_x_mean: the average body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. The same description applies for the 'body_acc_y_mean' and 'body_acc_z_mean'.

body_acc_x_sdv: the standard deviation of body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. The same description applies for the 'body_acc_y_sdv' and 'body_acc_z_sdv'.

body_gyro_x_mean: The average angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. The same description applies for the 'body_gyro_y_mean' and 'body_gyro_z_mean'.

body_gyro_x_sdv: The standar deviation of angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. The same description applies for the 'body_gyro_y_sdv' and 'body_gyro_z_sdv'.
